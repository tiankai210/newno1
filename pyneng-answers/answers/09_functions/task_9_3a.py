Task 9.3a

Make a copy of the code from the task 9.3.

Add this functionality: add support for configuration when the port is in VLAN 1
and the access port setting looks like this:
    interface FastEthernet0/20
        switchport mode access
        duplex auto

In this case, information should be added to the dictionary that the port in VLAN 1
Dictionary example:
    {'FastEthernet0/12': 10,
     'FastEthernet0/14': 11,
     'FastEthernet0/20': 1 }

The function must have one parameter, config_filename, which expects as an argument
the name of the configuration file.

Check the operation of the function using the config_sw2.txt file.

Restriction: All tasks must be done using the topics covered in this and previous chapters.
